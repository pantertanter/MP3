# Mini Project 3: Machine Learning for Prediction by Regression

## Overview
In this mini project, we aim to develop a regression model to predict property prices in King County, USA, using the provided dataset (house-data.csv). We will perform data cleaning, exploration, feature engineering, and model training to accomplish this task.

## Dataset
- **File**: house-data.csv
- **Description**: Contains data from the property market in King County, USA.
- **Features**: Various attributes such as number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, location details, etc.
- **Target Variable**: Price (property price)

## Tasks Completed
1. **Data Cleaning**: Checked for missing values, outliers, and performed necessary cleaning operations.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Explored the dataset using summary statistics, visualizations, and correlation analysis to understand the relationships between variables.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Selected relevant features and engineered new ones if necessary to improve model performance.
4. **Model Training**: Trained two regression models - Linear Regression and Lasso Regression - to predict property prices.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluated the performance of the models using metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared.
6. **Visualization**: Visualized the actual versus predicted prices to assess the model's performance graphically.

## Usage
1. **Dependencies**: Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn).
2. **Data Loading**: Load the dataset from house-data.csv using the provided code.
3. **Data Cleaning and Exploration**: Use the provided functions to clean and explore the data.
4. **Feature Engineering**: Modify or add features as needed to improve model performance.
5. **Model Training**: Train regression models using Linear Regression and Lasso Regression.
6. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the models using appropriate metrics and visualize the results.

## Results
- The linear regression model achieved an R-squared value of approximately 0.48, indicating that it explains about 48% of the variance in property prices.
- The Lasso regression model also performed well, but further experimentation with hyperparameters may be needed for optimal performance.

## Conclusion
- The regression models developed in this project can be used to predict property prices in King County, USA, based on relevant features.
- Further refinement of the models and feature engineering may improve their performance.
